<h2>Transcending instincts: crowdsourced data can fix your motivation</h2>
<p>We often donâ€™t have problems with defining our goals, but we have problems with getting there. Agnis shows us how socially influencing systems can help in transforming our lives.</p>

<p>Improving our health and well-being, preferring eco-friendly choices will be so much easier once we become aware of others succeeding on their way to the same goals. Dr. Agnis Stibe is a Sociotech Designer at MIT Media Lab. He has worked for a number of Fortune 100 companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Oracle. Dr. Stibe has twice been recognized by the Minister of Education and Science of Latvia for his long-term creative work.</p>

<p>Agnis envisions future Persuasive Cities that are encouraging healthy and sustainable routines. He believes that our world can become a better place through purposefully designed urban spaces that successfully blend technological advancements with human nature. His research is built upon socio-psychological theories to design Socially Influencing Systems (SIS) for health behavior change at scale.</p>
